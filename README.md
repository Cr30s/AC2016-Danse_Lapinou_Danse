# AC2016-Danse_Lapinou_Danse
Danse Lapinou, Danse ! is a game jam game for SEGA MegaDrive/Genesis made for the AC2016

Developed and compiled with the SGDK 1.12. Thanks and shout out to Stehane for the SDK : https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK/wiki

My first attempt at creating a game with the SGDK so it's messy (at least ;) ) and unfinished : no win, no score, no reset and graphic bugs all along
The game intends to be a Simon's game clone : Lapinou (the rabbit) dances at the beginning of each turn then you have to imitate him by pressing left/right/A

The theme of the jam was Easter holidays (so comes the rabbit) and the constraints were "a la game & watch" and "only 2 direction buttons and one for Action"

Cheers.
